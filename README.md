# Image-classification
This repository contains the code to perform extraction of features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) using different classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). 
Please note that these files were created using GoogleColab. If you select preview, you can actually view the code. But, if you try to see the code section, you will just be able to see the raw output. I recommend either using Googlecolab or converting the .ipynb file to suit functionality.
There are certain comments that explain some outputs and metrics according to the dataset I used. Those can be used as a reference when yesting your own dataset.
